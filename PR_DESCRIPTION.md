# Improve data-science-templates for consistency and robustness

This PR enhances the data science workspace templates for better consistency, reliability, and documentation.

## Changes Made

### Common Improvements
- Fixed CPU resource request formatting in both templates
- Added missing metadata for host monitoring (CPU, memory, load average)
- Added comprehensive documentation with README files for both templates
- Added comments to clarify security settings and error handling

### ML Training Template Improvements
- Added default namespace value ("coder")
- Fixed CPU resource requests format
- Added Load Average (Host) metadata
- Added README with complete documentation

### Data Engineering Template Improvements
- Standardized security context settings (fs_group=1000 instead of 100)
- Set image_pull_policy to "Always" for consistent image updates
- Added host metrics (CPU, memory, load average)
- Improved startup script error handling and documentation
- Added security comments for JupyterLab configuration
- Added README with complete documentation

## Testing

Both templates have been tested by:
1. Creating template versions in Coder
2. Creating test workspaces from the templates
3. Verifying the workspaces start correctly
4. Confirming the improvements work as expected

## Summary

These changes enhance the templates to be more aligned with Kubernetes best practices and the reference template. The improvements focus on consistent resource management, better security settings, improved error handling, and comprehensive documentation to help users understand and use the templates effectively.
